4sacan stands for: For Smart Access Control Attending to Needs
*S*ecure *S*mart access control for *S*elf *S*overeign people in processes that attend to needs

~ forsaken: leaving the old centralised access control world

using discipl core, access for any self sovereign actor can be granted and revoked by another actor if it is lawfully the actor that decides. The idea is that handling needs of people sometimes involves other human people to evaluate private information and that access to information shared in private with organisations must always still be granted to specific members of these organisations by the subject in need (or as described in law) on a need to know basis.
